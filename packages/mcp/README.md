# @damatjs/mcp

> A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets an AI assistant discover and install Damat modules.

`@damatjs/mcp` exposes the Damat **module registry** and the **`damat module`
CLI** to any MCP client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, …). With it
connected, an assistant can search a registry for an existing module, inspect
it, and install it into your app — copying the module, registering it in
`damat.config.ts`, syncing env vars, and installing npm packages — all without
you leaving the conversation.

It is intentionally **dependency-free**: it speaks the MCP stdio transport
(newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0) directly and shells out to the `damat` CLI for
the actual install. Run it with Bun — no build step.

## Install

The server runs straight from source with Bun:

```bash
bun run packages/mcp/bin/damat-mcp.ts
```

Inside a generated Damat app, add it as a dependency and use the `damat-mcp` bin:

```bash
bun add -D @damatjs/mcp
```

## Quick start (Claude Code)

Add an `.mcp.json` to your project root (this repo already ships one):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "damat-modules": {
      "command": "bun",
      "args": ["run", "packages/mcp/bin/damat-mcp.ts"],
      "env": {
        "DAMAT_MODULE_REGISTRY": "https://registry.damatjs.dev/index.json",
        "DAMAT_APP_DIR": ".",
        "DAMAT_CLI": "damat"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In a published app, point `args` at the installed bin instead:

```json
{ "command": "bunx", "args": ["damat-mcp"] }
```

Then ask your assistant: *"Find a Damat auth module and install it."* It will
call `search_modules` → `module_info` → `add_module`, then tell you to run
migrations.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `list_modules` | List every module in the configured registry (ref, description, latest version, verification, owner). |
| `search_modules` | Filter the registry by a query matched against ref, description and keywords. |
| `module_info` | Full registry details for one ref (e.g. `damatjs/user@0.2.0`) — read before installing. |
| `list_installed` | Scan the app's `src/modules` for installed modules (via their `module.json`). |
| `add_module` | Install a module by running `damat module add <source>` (registry ref, path, github shorthand, or git URL). Path/git sources are refused unless `allowUnverified: true` is passed; dependency lifecycle scripts stay off unless `allowScripts: true`. |

Installs are default-deny for anything a registry has not verified: the
assistant must set `allowUnverified` explicitly (after the user approved that
exact source) before a git/path install proceeds, and `bun add` runs with
`--ignore-scripts` unless `allowScripts` is set.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables (set them in `.mcp.json` → `env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DAMAT_MODULE_REGISTRY` | — | Registry index location: an http(s) URL to the index JSON, a path to a `registry.json`, or a directory containing one. Without it, registry tools return guidance and you can still install from git/local paths. |
| `DAMAT_APP_DIR` | `process.cwd()` | Working directory of the target app. Installs and "installed" scans run here. |
| `DAMAT_CLI` | `damat` | Command used to invoke the CLI. May include args, e.g. `bun /abs/packages/cli/damat/src/cli.ts`. |
| `DAMAT_MODULE_VERIFY` | `warn` | Forwarded to the CLI: `off` \| `warn` \| `require` — the install-time verification policy. |

A sample registry index is provided in
[`registry.example.json`](./registry.example.json). The registry schema matches
[`@damatjs/module`'s registry entry types](../module/docs/registry.md).

## How it fits

- **Depends on:** nothing at runtime. It reads the registry index itself and
  invokes the `damat` CLI (`@damatjs/damat-cli`) for installs.
- **Built on:** the same module contract as
  [`@damatjs/module`](../module/README.md) — registry refs, the `module.json`
  manifest, and the verification gate.
